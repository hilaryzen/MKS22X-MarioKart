Hilary: Added map

5/20

Kayla: Wrote Kart class and began working on movement

Hilary: Added to Kart class and researched finding the color of an image

5/21

Kayla: I started to experiment with keys.  I got the map moving based on whether the user clicks w, a, s, or d.

Hilary: I started the Player class and wrote isOnRoad for the Kart class.

5/22

Kayla: After the simple movements, I turned to rotations.  The map should now be rotating left or right based on the keys r and t.  I spawned a kart and adjusted the initial coordinates for the image so that it would zoom in on the starting line.

5/23

Kayla: I tried to fix the rotations as they were not working as I had imagined. Now the world should spin based on the kart's position.
